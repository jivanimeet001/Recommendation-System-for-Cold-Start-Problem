# Recommendation System for Cold-Start Problem

## Abstract
This project aims to tackle the cold-start problem in recommendation systems using collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. A neural network-based recommendation system is developed, consisting of modules for embedding items and users, and recommendation based on these embeddings. Precision, recall, and accuracy metrics are used to evaluate the system's effectiveness.

## Introduction
Recommendation systems are vital for personalized user experiences but face challenges with new users or items (cold-start problem). Content-based and collaborative filtering, along with hybrid approaches, have been proposed to address this issue. This project develops a neural network-based system to handle cold-start problems.

## Methodology/Solution
The approach includes preprocessing data, creating embeddings for articles and users, calculating similarities, and generating top-N recommendations. Various metrics like Recall@N and NDCG@N are used for evaluation through cross-validation techniques.

## Evaluation
Different models including Popularity, Content-Based, Collaborative Filtering, and Hybrid are evaluated using recall metrics. Collaborative Filtering, particularly based on SVD matrix factorization, outperforms other models in terms of recall values.

## Conclusion
Collaborative filtering is effective but susceptible to the cold-start problem, while content-based filtering offers personalized recommendations regardless of new users or items. Hybrid approaches combining both methods show promising results. Evaluation through cross-validation is crucial for model generalization.
